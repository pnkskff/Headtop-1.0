# Headtop

I. INTRO:

  1. Headtop API url: 
  
     a. API is hosted at: 
     
        - Need to host App on a different Server: 
     
          * Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/
     
          * Netlify: https://www.netlify.com/

  2. This is a Web App that at its most basic, allows a User to:

     a. Create a List.

     b. Vote on importance of Items in the List, with Sort set to display Most Important/Liked first.

     c. Vote on Dislike of Items in the List, Dislikes do not affect Sort as this App is more about what is Important to User, and not what User Likes/Dislikes.
